## American Journal of Freestanding Research Psychology - 

Research papers are notoriously difficult to access, especially in academic fields like philosophy, science, and psychology. Journals are expensive to subscribe to, and buying reading right to single articles gets expensive fast. The onion-based journal aims to avoid that limitation. Itâ€™s actually legal to use, too, since all papers featured on the site were submitted by their original authors in an effort to make knowledge more accessible to the world.
